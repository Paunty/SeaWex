        "\n",
        "This tutorial is based on the [YOLOv5-swift repository](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/yolov5-swift) by [Seeed-Studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/). This notebook shows training on **your own custom objects**. Many thanks to USeeed-Studio for putting this repository together - we hope that in combination with clean data management tools at Roboflow, this technologoy will become easily accessible to any developer wishing to use computer vision in their projects.\n",

        "### Accompanying Blog Post\n",
        "\n",
        "We recommend that you follow along in this notebook while reading the blog post on [how to train YOLOv5](https://blog.roboflow.ai/how-to-train-yolov5-on-a-custom-dataset/), concurrently.\n",

        "In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps required to train YOLOv5 on your custom objects. We use a [public blood cell detection dataset](https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/bccd), which is open source and free to use. You can also use this notebook on your own data.\n",
        "\n",
        "To train our detector we take the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Install YOLOv5 dependencies\n",
        "* Download custom YOLOv5 object detection data\n",
        "* Write our YOLOv5 Training configuration\n",
        "* Run YOLOv5 training\n",
        "* Evaluate YOLOv5 performance\n",
        "* Visualize YOLOv5 training data\n",
        "* Run YOLOv5 inference on test images\n",
        "* Export saved YOLOv5 weights for future inference\n",
